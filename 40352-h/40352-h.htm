<h2>SPORT FOR RATEPAYERS.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>August 1st.</i>&mdash;Deer-shooting
in Victoria Park commences.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;Distribution of
venison to &quot;Progressive&quot;
County Councillors and their
families&mdash;especially to Aldermen.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;Stalking American
bison in the Marylebone disused
grave-yard is permitted
from this day. A staff of
competent surgeons will be

<p class="indent"><i>4th.</i>&mdash;Chamois-coursing in
Brockwell Park.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>5th.</i>&mdash;A few rogue elephants
having been imported (at considerable
expense to the rates),

Park, the Chairman of the
L. C. C., assisted by the Park-keepers,
will give an exhibition
of the method employed
in snaring them. The elephants
in the Zoological Gardens
will be expected to
assist.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>6th.</i>&mdash;<i>Bank Holiday.</i>&mdash;Popular
festival on Hampstead

the use of bullet-proof coats.
No dynamite to be employed

Scrubbs between the Council&#39;s

round the ground to
prevent the ostriches escaping
into the adjoining
country.</p>

(dropped in the contests) to
West-End bonnet-makers at

<p>Yes, and how&mdash;too soon youth&#39;s early day flies&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">In the purling brook which seaward races</p>

<p class="i2">Casting furtive lines in pleasant places.</p>

<p>Then the lickings! How we took them, scorning</p>
<p class="i2">Girlish outcry, though we made grimaces;</p>
<p>Only smiled to find ourselves next morning</p>
<p class="i2">Somewhat marked with lines in pleasant places!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Alma Mater, whether young or olden,</p>

<p>Treasured memories, days of boyhood golden,</p>

<h2>LONDON BICYCLISTS.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
[&quot;Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> said that he was informed by
the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police
that undoubtedly numerous accidents were caused
by bicycles and tricycles, though he was not prepared
to say from the cause of the machines passing
on the near instead of the off side of the road.
Bicycles and tricycles were carriages, and should
conform to the rules of the road, and the police, as
far as possible, enforced the law as to riding to the
common danger.&quot;&mdash;<i>Daily Graphic, July 25.</i>]</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Round the omnibus, past the van,</p>
<p class="i2">Rushing on with a reckless reel,</p>
<p>Darts that horrible nuisance, an</p>
<p class="i2">Ardent cyclist resolved that he&#39;ll</p>
<p>Ride past everything he can,</p>
<p>Heed not woman, or child, or man,</p>
<p>Beat some record, some ride from Dan</p>
<p>To Beersheba; that seems his plan.</p>
<p>Why does not the Home Office ban</p>
<p class="i2">London fiends of the whirling wheel?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Let them ride in the country so,</p>
<p class="i2">Dart from Duncansbay Head to Deal,</p>
<p>Shoot as straight as the flight of crow,</p>
<p class="i2">Sweep as swallow that seeks a meal,</p>
<p>We don&#39;t care how the deuce they go,</p>
<p>But in thoroughfares where we know</p>
<p>Cyclists, hurrying to and fro,</p>
<p>Make each peaceable man their foe,</p>
<p>Riders, walkers alike cry &quot;Whoa!</p>
<p class="i2">Stop these fiends of the whirling wheel!&quot;</p>

<h2>ODE ON SACRIFICE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Amid the glowing pageant of the year</p>
<p>There comes too soon th&#39; inevitable shock,</p>
<p>That token of the season sere,</p>
<p>To the unthinking fair so cheaply dear,</p>
<p>Who, like to shipwreck&#39;d seamen, do it hail,</p>
<p>And cry, &quot;A Sale! a Sale!</p>
<p>A Sale! a Summer Sale of Surplus Stock!&quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>See, how, like busy-humming bees</p>
<p>Around the ineffable fragrance of the lime,</p>
<p>Woman, unsparing of the salesman&#39;s time,</p>
<p>Reviews the stock, and chaffers at her ease,</p>
<p>Nor yet, for all her talking, purchases,</p>
<p>But takes away, with copper-bulgèd purse,</p>
<p>The textile harvest of a quiet eye,</p>
<p>Great bargains still unbought, and power to buy.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Or she, her daylong, garrulous labour done,</p>
<p>Some victory o&#39;er reluctant remnants won,</p>
<p>Fresh from the trophies of her skill,</p>
<p>Things that she needed not, nor ever will,</p>
<p>She takes the well-earned bun;</p>
<p>Ambrosial food, <span class="smcap">Demeter</span> erst design&#39;d</p>
<p>As the appropriate food of womankind,</p>
<p>Plain, or with comfits deck&#39;d and spice;</p>
<p>Or, daintier, dallies with an ice.</p>
<p>Nor feels in heart the worse</p>
<p>Because the haberdashers thus disperse</p>
<p>Their surplus stock at an astounding sacrifice!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Yet Contemplation pauses to review</p>
<p>The destinies that meet the silkworm&#39;s care,</p>
<p>The fate of fabrics whose materials grew</p>
<p>In the same fields of cotton or of flax,</p>
<p>Or waved on fellow-flockmen&#39;s fleecy backs,</p>
<p>And the same mill, loom, case, emporium, shelf, did share.</p>

<h2>THE RIDER&#39;S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>For Use in Rotten Row.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Question.</i> What part of London do you consider the most dangerous
for an equestrian?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Answer.</i> That part of the Park known as Rotten Row.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Why is it so dangerous?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Because it is overcrowded in the Season, and at all times imperfectly
kept.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> What do you mean by &quot;imperfectly kept&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> I mean that the soil is not free from bricks and other impediments
to comfortable and safe riding.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Why do you go to Rotten Row?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Because it is the most convenient place in London for the residents
of the West End.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> But would not Battersea Park do as well?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> It is farther afield, and at present, so far as the rides are concerned,
given over to the charms of solitude.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> And is not the Regent&#39;s Park also available for equestrians?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> To some extent; but the roads in that rather distant pleasaunce
are not comparable for a moment with the ride within view of the
Serpentine.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Would a ride in Kensington Gardens be an advantage?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Yes, to some extent; still it would scarcely be as convenient
as the present exercising ground.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Then you admit that there are (and might be) pleasant rides
other than Rotten Row?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Certainly; but that fact does not dispense with the necessity of
reform in existing institutions.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Then you consider the raising of other issues is merely a plan to
confuse and obliterate the original contention?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Assuredly; and it is a policy that has been tried before with
success to obstructors and failure to the grievance-mongers.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> So as two blacks do not make one white you and all believe that
Rotten Row should be carefully inspected and the causes of the recent
accidents ascertained and remedied?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> I do; and, further, am convinced that such a course would be
for the benefit of the public in general and riders in Rotten Row in
particular.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Poets don&#39;t seem to have much self-possession.
He seems perfectly overcome by hearing my name like
that. If only he doesn&#39;t lose his head completely and say something
about my wretched letter!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I&#39;d better tell &#39;em before they find out for
themselves. (<i>Aloud; desperately.</i>)
My lady, I&mdash;I feel
I ought to explain at once
how I come to be going down
to Wyvern like this.</p>

<p class="right">
[Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> <i>only just
suppresses a terrified
protest</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>benignly
amused</i>). My good Sir,
there&#39;s not the slightest
necessity, I am perfectly
aware of who you are, and
everything about you!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>incredulously</i>).
But really I don&#39;t see <i>how</i>
your ladyship&mdash;&mdash;Why, I
haven&#39;t said a <i>word</i> that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>with a solemn
waggishness</i>). Celebrities
who mean to preserve their
<i>incognito</i> shouldn&#39;t allow
their friends to see them off.
I happened to hear a certain
<i>Andromeda</i> mentioned, and
that was quite enough for
Me!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself, relieved</i>).
She knows; seen
the sketch of me in the <i>Dog
Fancier</i>, I expect; goes in
for breeding bulls herself,
very likely. Well, that&#39;s a
load off my mind! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
You don&#39;t say so, my lady.
I&#39;d no idea your ladyship
would have any taste that
way; most agreeable surprise
to me, I can assure you!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> I see no reason
for <i>surprise</i> in the
matter. I have always
endeavoured to cultivate my
taste in all directions; to
keep in touch with every
modern development. I
make it a rule to read and
see <i>everything</i>. Of course,
I have no time to give more
than a rapid glance at most
things; but I hope some day
to be able to have another
look at your <i>Andromeda</i>. I
hear the most glowing accounts
from all the judges.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She
knows all the judges! She

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She&#39;s going to be chummy now! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Oh&mdash;manners? yes, I&mdash;I daresay&mdash;but still&mdash;but

Well, if you&#39;re sure they won&#39;t <i>mind</i> it, because I&#39;m not used to
this sort of thing, so I put myself in your hands,&mdash;for, of course, <i>you</i>
know what brought me down here?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He means my foolish letter! Oh, I

I&mdash;I think I do. I mean, I <i>do</i> know&mdash;but&mdash;but <i>please</i> forget
it&mdash;<i>indeed</i> you must!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Forget I&#39;ve come down as a vet? The <span class="smcap">Culverins</span>
will take care I don&#39;t forget that! (<i>Aloud.</i>) But, I say, it&#39;s
all very well; but how <i>can</i> I? Why, look here; I was told I was to

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>nettled</i>). I don&#39;t mind <i>who</i> knows. <i>I&#39;m</i> not ashamed of
it, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>&mdash;whatever you may be!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself, exasperated</i>). He dares to imply that <i>I</i>&#39;ve
done something to be ashamed of! (<i>Aloud; haughtily.</i>) I&#39;m <i>not</i>

that&mdash;that one may do things which one wouldn&#39;t care to be reminded
of publicly? I don&#39;t <i>wish</i> it&mdash;isn&#39;t <i>that</i> enough?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I see what she&#39;s at now&mdash;doesn&#39;t want it to
come out that she&#39;s travelled down here with a vet! (<i>Aloud,

sorry for having gone out of your way to be friendly, why, I&#39;m not
the person to take advantage of it. I hope I know how to behave.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>He takes refuge in offended silence.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Why did I say anything at all! I&#39;ve only
made things worse&mdash;I&#39;ve let him see that he <i>has</i> an advantage.
And he&#39;s certain to use it sooner or later&mdash;unless I am civil to him.
I&#39;ve offended him now&mdash;and I shall <i>have</i> to make it up with him!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I thought all along she didn&#39;t seem as

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>waking up</i>). Well, Mr. <span class="smcap">Andromeda</span>, I should have

left the station.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). That&#39;s <i>some</i> comfort! (<i>Aloud.</i>) You

<h2>THE BANK HOLIDAY
DREAM BOOK.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Compiled by our Pet Pessimist.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">If you imagine that it will
be fine, and consequently that
you can don the lightest of
attire, you may be sure that it
will be cold and wet, and absolutely
unsuitable to travelling.</p>

<p class="indent">If you fancy that you will
enjoy a delightful visit to some
intimate friends, you will find
that you have had your journey
to a spot &quot;ten miles from anywhere&quot;
for nothing, as your
intended hosts have gone
abroad for the season.</p>

<p class="indent">If you believe that you are
seeing a favourite piece being
played admirably at a West
End theatre, you will discover
that the programme was altered
four days ago, and that the
temple of the drama will not
reopen until the autumn.</p>

<p class="indent">If you arrange to go abroad
with a friend, you will quarrel
with your acquaintance on the
following morning, and disarrange
your plans for a lifetime.</p>

<p class="indent">Lastly, if you dream that
you have decided to give up
gadding about on a bank holiday
to remain at home, you will
see that it is better to follow
your fancy, and avoid the risk
of making a mistake by adventuring
to strange places and
pastures new.</p>

<h2>LORD ORMONT&#39;S MATE AND MATEY&#39;S AMINTA.</h2>

<p class="center">BY G***GE M*R*D*TH.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Volume II.</span></p>

<p class="indent">The die was now a-casting. Hurtled though devious windings
far from ordered realms where the Syntax Queen holds sway, spinning
this way and that like the whipped box-wood beloved of youth
but deadly to the gout-ridden toes of the home-faring Alderman,
now sinking to a fall, now impetuously whirled on a devil-dance,
clamorous as Cocytus, the lost souls filling it to the brink, at last the
meaning glimmered to the eye&mdash;not that wherein dead time hung
just above the underlids, but the common reading eye a-thirst for
meanings, baffled again and again and drooping a soporific lid slowly,
nose a-snore, and indolent mind lapped in slumber. They discussed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I a Literary Causerie?&quot; breathed <span class="smcap">Aminta</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but food for such.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And if I am?&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Turgidity masquerading as depth. Was ever cavalry general so
tortured into symbolism?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remain,&quot; she insisted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I go to Paris,&quot; was his retort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My aunt stays with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank Heaven!&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p class="indent">The design was manifest. Who should mistake it? For a fencer
plays you the acrobat, a measure he, poised on a plum-box with
jargon-mouth agape for what shall come to it. Is the man unconscious?
The worse his fate. For the fact is this. All are Meredithians
in dialogue, tarred with one brush abysmally plunged in the
hot and steaming tank, a general tarred, a tarred tutor, a tarred
sister, aunt reeking of the tar and General&#39;s Doubtful Lady chin-deep
in the compound, and no distinction.</p>

<p class="indent">Clatter, crash, bang. Helter-skelter comes dashing Lady <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>,
a forest at her heels dragged in chains for all a neighbour
may pout and fret and ride to hounds. She switched him a brat-face
patter-down of an apology tamed to the net-ponds of a busk-madder,
blue nose vermilion, mannish to the outside, breathing flames and
scattering apish hop-poles like a parachute blown into space by the
bellows of a hugger-mugger conformity. &quot;I can mew,&quot; she said.
&quot;Old women can; it&#39;s a way they have. The person you call ...
but no&mdash;I pass it. Was ever such folly in a man? And that man my
brother <span class="smcap">Rowsley</span>. But you have seen her you say&mdash;a Spaniard&mdash;<i>Ay
de mi; Señorita</i>, and the rest of the gibberish. What is her colour?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The question flicked him like a hansom&#39;s whip, that plucks you
out an optic, policeman in helmet looking on, stolid on the mumchance.
Out it goes at whip-end and no remedy, blue, green,
brown or bloodshot. Glass can imitate or porcelain, and a pretty
trade&#39;s a-doing in these, making a man like two light-houses, one
fixed as fate, the other revolving like the earth on its axis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Brown</span>,&quot; he answered, humbly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Morsfield</span>&#39;s after her,&quot; said Lady <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he&#39;s dangerous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can trounce such. Did it at school, and can remember the
trick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A lady came moving onward. She had that in her gait which
showed command, her bonnet puckered to the front, a fat aunt
trailing behind. They came steadily. It was <span class="smcap">Aminta</span> with her aunt.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord <span class="smcap">Ormont</span>, his temper ablaze like his manuscript, thirty-four
pages, neither more nor less, fortifications planned, advice given
gratis to the loutish neglecting nation, stepped forward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must remove her,&quot; he declared to <span class="smcap">Weyburn</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the aunt?&quot; questioned <span class="smcap">Matey</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She must go too. See to it quickly!&quot; He fell back, the irrevocable
quivering in his eyeball, destiny mocking with careless glee,
while <span class="smcap">Morsfield</span> and a bully-captain saw their chances and just
missed the taking.</p>

<p class="indent">Away they clattered, <span class="smcap">Matey</span> and <span class="smcap">Aminta</span>, leaving the <span class="smcap">Pagnell</span> to
her passion-breathing <span class="smcap">Morsfield</span>.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 23.</i>&mdash;Quite like old times to
hear <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span> saying a few plain things about landlords; <span class="smcap">Prince
Arthur</span> replying; <span class="smcap">Tim</span> growling out occasional contradiction; whilst
<span class="smcap">O&#39;Brien</span> hotly interrupts. To make the reminiscence complete <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>
contributes a speech in which he heaps contumely and scorn on
representatives of Irish nationality. <span class="smcap">Tim</span> reminds him how different
was his attitude, how varied his voice, at epoch of Kilmainham Treaty.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Tim</span> has a rough but effective way of fastening upon a name
or phrase, and even blatantly reiterating it. Thus, when <span class="smcap">Old
Morality</span>, in his kindly manner, once alluded to a visit paid to him
at a critical time by his &quot;old friend Mr. <span class="smcap">Walter</span>,&quot; <span class="smcap">Tim</span> leaped
down upon it, and, characteristically leaving out the customary
appellation, filled the air with scornful reference to &quot;my old friend
<span class="smcap">Walter</span>.&quot; To-night, desiring to bring into sharp contrast <span class="smcap">Joseph&#39;s</span>
present attitude towards Ireland and the landlord party with that
assumed by him twelve years ago, he insisted upon calling the
Arrears Bill of 1882 &quot;the Chamberlain Act.&quot; It wasn&#39;t <span class="smcap">Joseph&#39;s</span>
personal possession or invention any more than it was the <span class="smcap">Squire of
Malwood&#39;s</span>. But that way of putting it doubly suited <span class="smcap">Tim&#39;s</span> purpose.
It permitted him, without breach of order, to allude by name
to the member for West Birmingham; there&#39;s a good deal in a name
when the syllables are hissed forth with infinite hate and scorn.
Also it accentuated the changed position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Ireland to which
further reflection and honest conviction have brought the prime
mover in the Kilmainham Treaty.</p>

<p class="indent">Irish Members, forgetting their own quarrels with <span class="smcap">Tim</span> as he
fustigated the common enemy, roared with delight. A broad smile
lighted up the serried ranks of the Liberals. <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> wore
a decorous look of sympathy with his wronged right hon. friend.
The Duke of <span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>,&mdash;&quot;late the Leader of the Liberal Party,&quot;&mdash;from
the Peers&#39; Gallery surveyed the scene with stolid countenance.
<span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, orchid-decked, sat in his corner seat below the gangway,
staring straight before him as one who saw not neither did he hear.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span> goes on the rampage. Evicted
Tenants Bill read second time.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;As has been noted on an earlier occasion, Britannia has
no bulwarks, no towers along her steep. It is, consequently, the
more comforting to know that <span class="smcap">Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett</span> (Knight)
keeps his eye on things abroad as they affect the interests of British
citizens. The Member for <span class="smcap">Sark</span> tells me he has a faded copy of the
<i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> containing its famous note of warning to <span class="smcap">Napoleon
the Third</span>. Was published at time of the irruption of Colonels.
These gentlemen, sitting on boulevards sipping absinthe, used to
twirl their moustache and&mdash;<i>sacrrée!</i>&mdash;growl hints of what they
would do when they as conquerors walked down Piccadillee, and
rioted in the riches of Leestar Square.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Napoleon the Third</span> did not escape suspicion of fanning this
flame. Howbeit the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> came out one Saturday
morning with a leading article commencing: &quot;We have our eye on
<span class="smcap">Napoleon the Third</span>, Emperor of the French.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus <span class="smcap">Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett</span> (Knight) digs eagle claws into
the aerie heights of the Clock Tower, and watches over the interests
and cares of an Empire on which the sun rarely sets.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the kinder of him,&quot; <span class="smcap">Sark</span> says, &quot;since they cannot be said
directly to concern him. In an effort to redress the balance between
the Old World and the New, United States has lent us <span class="smcap">Ashmead</span>.
The temporary character of the arrangement makes only the more
generous his concern for the interests of the Empire in which he
lodges.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the peculiar circumstances of the case those able young men,
<span class="smcap">Edward Grey</span> and <span class="smcap">Sydney Buxton</span>, might be a little less openly
contemptuous in their treatment of the Patriotic Emigrant. Hard
to say at which office door, Foreign or Colonial, <span class="smcap">Ashmead</span> bangs his
head with more distressful result. He takes them in succession, with
dogged courage that would in anyone else excite admiration. Of the
two janitors, perhaps <span class="smcap">Edward Grey&#39;s</span> touch is the lightest. He
replies with a solemn gravity that puzzles <span class="smcap">Ashmead</span>, and keeps him
brooding till <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> stays the merry laughter of the House by
calling on the next question. <span class="smcap">Buxton</span> is more openly contemptuous,
more severely sarcastic, and sometimes, when <span class="smcap">Ashmead&#39;s</span> prattling,
of no consequence in the House, might possibly have serious effect
when cabled to the Transvaal where they think all Members of
Parliament are responsible men, he smartly raps out. Between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page060" id="page060"></a>[pg&nbsp;060]</span>
two the Patriot&mdash;made in Brooklyn, plated in Sheffield&mdash;has a bad
time of it. Has long learned how much sharper than a serpent&#39;s
tooth is the tongue of an Under Secretary of State.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second
Reading of Equalisation of London Rates Bill moved.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Lords took Budget Bill in hand to-night. <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>
asked for week&#39;s interval. This looked like fighting. At least there
would be a reconnaissance in force led by the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>. House full;
peerless Peeresses looked down from side gallery; <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> in his
place; <span class="smcap">Devonshire</span> in his&mdash;not Chatsworth; that going to be shut
up; but corner seat below gangway; <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> hovering about,
settled down at length in seat of Leader. Clerk read Orders of the
Day. &quot;Finance Bill second reading.&quot; &quot;I move the Bill be read a
second time,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>, politely taking his hat off to lady in
gallery immediately opposite. Then he sat down.</p>

<p class="indent">Here was a pretty go! Expected <span class="smcap">Premier</span> would make brilliant
speech in support of Bill; the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> would reply; fireworks would
fizz all round, and, though perhaps Budget Bill might be saved,
<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> would be pummelled. <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> takes oddest,
most unparliamentary view of his duty. The Lords, he said, when
last week subject was mooted, have nothing to do with Budget Bill,
unless indeed they are prepared to throw it out. &quot;Will you do
that?&quot; he asked. &quot;No,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>, looking as if he would
much rather say &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Very well then,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>, &quot;all
speeches on the subject must be barren.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This to the Barons seemed lamentably personal.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> illustrated his point by declining for his own part to
make a speech. Still there was talk; barren speeches for three hours;
audience gradually dwindling: only a few left to witness spectacle of
<span class="smcap">Halsbury&#39;s</span> blue blood boiling over with indignation at sacrilegious
assault on landed aristocracy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you want to make your flesh creep,&quot; says <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, &quot;you should
hear <span class="smcap">Halsbury</span>, raising to full height his majestic figure, throwing
the shadow of his proudly aquiline profile fiercely on the steps of the
Throne where some minions of the Government cowered, exclaim, &#39;My
Lords, I detect in this Bill a hostile spirit towards the landed aristocracy.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A <span class="smcap">Halsbury</span>! a <span class="smcap">Halsbury</span>!&quot; menacingly muttered <span class="smcap">Feversham</span>
and some other fiery crusaders.</p>

<p class="indent">For the moment, so deeply was the assembly stirred, a conflict
between the two Houses seemed imminent. But Black Rod coming
to take away the Mace the tumult subsided, and Lord <span class="smcap">Halsbury</span>
went home in a four-wheeler.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget read second time in Lords.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Scene in Commons quite changed; properties remain but
leading characters altered. After unprecedented run, Budget Bill
withdrawn; Irish Evicted Tenants Bill now underlined on bills.
<span class="smcap">John Morley</span> succeeds the <span class="smcap">Squire</span>; Irish Members take up the
buzzing of the no longer Busy B&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the <span class="smcap">Squire</span>, he takes well-earned, though only comparative
rest; preparing for congratulatory feast spread for him next Wednesday.
Like good boy whose work is done is now going to have his
dinner. Also <span class="smcap">Rigby</span> and <span class="smcap">Bob Reid</span>, who bore with him the heat and
burden of the day. It&#39;s a sort of Parliamentary Millennium. The
<span class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> sits down with the <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>;
the <span class="smcap">Solicitor-General</span> puts his hand on the cockatrice&#39;s
den (situate in the neighbourhood of <span class="smcap">Tommy Bowles</span>); and <span class="smcap">Frank
Lockwood</span> has drawn them.</p>

<p>ell, my dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, you, who hear
everything, will be glad to receive from me
the particulars of our Annual Farewell Charity
Fête, given this year at the Grafton Gallery
for the excellent object of providing the undeserving
with pink carnations. It was a
bazaar, a concert, and a fancy-dress ball, all
in one; everyone who is anyone was there,
and as they were all in costume, nobody could
tell who was who. It was indeed a very
brilliant scene.</p>

<p class="indent">I refused to hold a stall, for I had enough
to do writing out autographs of celebrities
(they sell splendidly), but it was hard work,
and there was an absurd fuss just because I made the trifling mistake
of signing &quot;Yours truly, <span class="smcap">George Meredith</span>&quot; across a photograph of
<span class="smcap">Arthur Roberts</span>. What did it matter? I really cannot see that it
made the slightest difference; the person had asked for an autograph of
<span class="smcap">Meredith</span> and he got it, <i>and</i> a portrait of <span class="smcap">Roberts</span> into the bargain!
so he ought to have been satisfied; but some people are strangely
exacting! There was a great run on the autograph of <span class="smcap">Sarah Bernhardt</span>
and I grew quite tired of signing <span class="smcap">Yvette</span>, <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Cissie Loftus</span>, however, it was all for the charity. I went as a
Perfect Gentleman, and it was quite a good disguise&mdash;hardly anyone
knew me! I saw <span class="smcap">Sir Bruce Skene</span> dressed as a Temperance Lecturer;
<span class="smcap">Gringoire</span> was there as the <i>Enemy of the People</i> with a
bunch of violets in his button-hole; the <span class="smcap">New Boy</span> went as <i>Becket</i>,
and <span class="smcap">Charley&#39;s Aunt</span> as the <i>Yellow Aster</i>. <span class="smcap">The Gentleman of
France</span> looked well as <i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i>. I recognised our old
friend <span class="smcap">Dorian Gray</span> in a gorgeous costume of purple and pearls, with
a crown on his head of crimson roses. He said he had come as a
Prose Poem, and he was selling Prose Poem-granates for the good of
the charity.</p>

<p class="indent">Here are some scraps of conversation I overheard in the crowd:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Enemy of the People</i> (<i>to</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Bruce Skene</span>). Been having a good
time lately?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Bruce.</i> Rather! Tremendous! I&#39;ve been doing nothing but
backing winners, and, what&#39;s more&mdash;(<i>chuckling</i>)&mdash;I&#39;ve at last got
that astronomer fellow to take my wife and child off my hands.
Isn&#39;t that jolly?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Enemy of the People.</i> Ah, really? She is coming to us in the
autumn, you know.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vivien, the Modern Eve</i> (<i>to the</i> New Boy). I cannot stay here any
longer. They never dust the drawing-room, the geraniums are
planted all wrong, and I do not like the anti-macassars. Will you
come with me?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>New Boy.</i> What a lark it would be! But I&#39;m afraid I must stay
and look after my white mice. You see, <span class="smcap">Bullock Major</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Belton</i> (<i>after her marriage</i>, <i>to</i> Charley&#39;s Aunt, <i>tearfully</i>).
He doesn&#39;t understand me, Aunty.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Charley&#39;s Aunt.</i> Never mind, my dear. Don&#39;t cry! You shall
come with me to Brazil; you&#39;ve heard me mention, perhaps, it&#39;s the
place where the nuts come from; and we&#39;ll get up an amateur performance
of the <i>Pantomime Rehearsal</i>!</p>

<p class="indent">We had all sorts of amusements. Under a palm, a palmist was
prophesying long journeys, second marriages, and affairs of the
heart to the white hand of giggling incredulity. Beautiful
musicians, in blue uniforms, with gold Hungarian bands round their
waists, were discoursing the sweetest strain that ever encouraged the
conversation of the unmusical. A feature of the bazaar, that
I invented, was a mechanical Sphinx behind a curtain. They asked
it questions&mdash;chiefly, what would win the Leger&mdash;and put a penny
in the slot. There never was any answer, and that was the
great joke!</p>

<p class="indent">The whole thing was undoubtedly a wonderful success&mdash;and I knew
it would be. I believed in my <i>Fête</i>, having always been rather a
fatalist.</p>

<p class="indent">And, in the rush of a worldly, frivolous existence, how great a
pleasure it is to think we should have aided&mdash;if ever so little&mdash;in
brightening the lives of the poor young fellows, kept, perhaps, all the
season through, in or near the hot pavement of Piccadilly, and with
not so much as a buttercup to remind them of the green fields, the
golden sunlight, the blue sky of the glorious country. To have
helped in so noble a cause as ours is a privilege that made us leave
the bazaar with tears of sympathy in our eyes, feeling better and
purer men and women. Long, long may the button-hole of improvidence
be filled by the wired carnation of judicious charity.</p>

<p>Believe me, dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>,</p>

<p class="center">Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Jemima the Penwoman</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">P.S.&mdash;An absurd name they gave me on account of the autograph
incident. You remember what &quot;<span class="smcap">Jim the Penman</span>&quot; was? Of course,
but there&#39;s no chance of my becoming the <span class="smcap">Pen-&quot;Wiper&quot;</span> in the

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
